Backbone-Simple-Boilerplate
===========================  
  
  
Simple Backbone.JS boilerplate application, designed for rapid HTML5 application development.  
  
In contrast to some Backbone boilerplates available, the focus of this architecture is reusability and simplicity. 
The entire application is configured using a properties object. All routes and pages are specified using HTML5 markup.

Uses:  
Backbone.JS - http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/  
Lodash - https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash  
jQuery - http://jquery.com  
ICanHaz.js - http://icanhazjs.com  
Require.JS - http://requirejs.org  
  
Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) has been used for the UI.  
  
  
Note:
- LoDash is a drop-in replacement for Underscore.JS (http://underscorejs.org/). Will work with either.  
- Also supports Handlebars templates (http://handlebarsjs.com/).

 
 
   
   
This is a work-in-progress. Let me know if you have any suggestions or issues.
